# Additional *utility types* for your `TypeScript` projects
> This repo includes several **utility types** and several **typing functions**, which can be used as an additional typing in your project

+ We use this **types** and **functions** in our `LevelUp` systems services
+ We will update this repo as soon as we discover new utility for our project
---
## **Usage:**
+ Now, we didn't declare modules and make it like a real *library*, but when time come, we'll deploy it on `npm`

**At now you can only *copy-paste* these types in your system**
---
> Setted `skipLibCheck` to `false` to prevent type errors in `.d.ts` delcarations files

+ **Some of the types depends on other types, so make sure you copied your code in right way**
